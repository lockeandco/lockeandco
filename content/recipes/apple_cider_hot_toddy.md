title: Apple Cider Hot Toddy
description: Warm and cozy, this Apple Cider Hot Toddy is perfect for sipping on
  by the fire this holiday season.
ingredients: |-
  * 4 ounces (1/2 cup) apple cider
  * 1 teaspoon lemon juice
  * 2 teaspoons honey
  * 1 cinnamon stick
  * 2 ounces (1/4 cup) bourbon
preparation: >-
  1. Combine the apple cider, lemon juice, honey, and cinnamon stick in a small
  saucepan.

  2. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, then reduce heat and simmer for about five minutes. 

  3. Remove from heat, stir in the bourbon, and serve immediately.


  Notes: 

  Look for unfiltered apple cider if you can find it. It has a lot more apple-tastic flavor to it!


  To make this for a crowd, use the following measurements: 1/2 gallon of apple cider, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 2/3 cup honey, 4 cinnamon sticks, 1 fifth bottle of bourbon. Makes 16 drinks. Keep simmering on the stove with a ladle and mugs nearby, or pour all into a slow cooker, and let cook on high for two hours before serving.
