Sent email. Email bounced back so I called back and got Cody's cell. Spoke with Cody and he told me to come in Saturday between 3 - 5 to do a tasting. 8/13/18 - RHT - Did a tasting with Cody and his bar Manager (never got his name) and they both loved it. They are re-doing their wine list and bar and currently don't even have a rye whiskey so are super excited to get ours. They will do a case at $48.99. 8/15/18 - RHT - Emailed Cody a copy of our W-9 and let him know it wouldn't be until afer Labor Day holiday that we can deliver his order due to hold-ups with our bottles.",

Good feedback on taste profile but said a could have more spicy notes. **Andrew no longer works here but Trevor is the new liquor purchaser and email him once we have product to taste. 7/26/18 - RHT - Emailed Trevor about scheduling a meeting. 8/6/18 - RHT - Sent Trevor a follow up email about scheduling a tasting. 8/7/18 - RHT - Set a tasting with Trevor for 8/9 at 2pm. 8/9/18 - RHT - Trevor called saying he needed to reschedule so it is now for Tuesday 8/14 at 10:30. We have 2 tasting at this time so Owen and I will need to split up. 8/14/18 - RHT - Did tasating with Trevor and about 7 other people. They all really liked it but Trevor said they don't do pre-sales so to reach back out once we have product.",
