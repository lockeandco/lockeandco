The process of distilling has brought with it valuable perspective. After years focused on business development, management and client service, as well as giving back (Rick serves on Denver Museum of Nature & Science’s Giving Club Council; Owen on the board of nonprofit Geneva Glen Camp) both established successful careers. 

However, the alchemy of creating something new through careful selection plus separation helped both distill down their own busy working lives. They extracted out one common element: celebrating the best of what life in Colorado has afforded.

This guiding principle, of sharing that experience, hit them while hand-cutting the aging discs from mature stands of aspen on family land flanking Central Colorado’s Mosquito Range. All the best days added up. The days spent camping, hiking, biking, fishing, snowboarding and skiing: that sunset toast after an unending day fly-fishing the Yampa, the warm nip from a flask on a cold chairlift, the laughter over a late-summer backyard game of cornhole. The unapologetic last howl at the moon.

What is Locke & Co. about? Good company. The same as those aspens quaking together in the wind: Connection through deep Colorado roots.
