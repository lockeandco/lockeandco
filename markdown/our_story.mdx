The Locke’s family roots in Colorado moonshining go back several generations. Owen Locke kept the 
craft tradition alive with an early knack for brewing that continued through college to graduate school, 
where he reconnected with Rick Talley. The high school friends and lacrosse teammates immediately 
recognized that their collaborative styles complimented each other well, working through MBA degrees together 
at the University of Denver’s Daniels College of Business as hand sale experts for Beam Suntory. 
It didn’t take them long to realize they could create something bolder and wilder than the premier spirits 
they offered at countless tastings. In 2010, the team bought a 23-gallon still that turned a garage hobby 
into a lifestyle with their first whiskey batches aged in small barrels.
